# ML2

Several characteristics linked to AP have been discovered in previous studies, and the test and form that will be used must take them into account // (in order to ...) // 
// The following list is based on those characteristics, and the questions should appear in the form to give an insight ...
and in the auditive test. // 
Verify the characteristics, give an insight on which characteristics we can find among the students that are also musicians on the campus.


## FORM 
- begin by : Do you have AP ? RP ?

*AP is known to have strong genetic associations, therefore AP possessors may have siblings who also possess AP (1).
- Are there musicians in your family ?
- Do you have members in your family that possess AP ?

* AP possessors reported beginning their studies at a very young age : there is a *critical period* in which the subject is more likely to develop AP (from around 4 to 9 y.o.) (2)
- What is your musical background (formation) ?
- (If AP) Do you remember at what age you developped AP ?

* We could also study the musical background. Is there a difference in the proportion of AP possessors between musicians more accustomed to improvise and musicians more accustomed to read a score ?



## TEST (describe the test more)
This auditive test should evaluate the capacities of each participant. When testing the identification of pitches, the error must be reported. The participants are expected to identify the pitch category but not the height (precising the octave).
// (PRECISING WHY) //

* AP possessors are more accurate in the range of their instrument (cello -> lower, violin -> upper) (3)
-> make sure to test a WIDE RANGE of notes. // Going from... to... // 
- and also to make a test with several timbres representing different instruments, and pure sines as well

* The goal is to study the occurence of AP for musicians that can play string and/or fretless instruments. 
- Can violin, cello and double bass players identify errors of less than one semitone ? The test must have a kind of special part where the auditive samples are a little deviated from the exact pitch, and the participants have the possibility to point out the error. // (Do we warn them at the beginning, by saying that it is possible that a pitch may be deviated?) // 
- If this assumption is true, we should get a bigger proportion of AP possessors that are guitar/violin/bass/cello players. 
- it could be also interesting to interview drummers and percussionists, because they may be a counter example of having received a musical education at a young age but not recognizing the pitches. 



## Steps

[Data Gathering]
The participants will be picked upon musicians of UNIL/EPFL campus, they can come from any musical background, musical formation, play of any instrument, as the goal is to study the influence of those factors. 

The form will be a Google form that we can send by email to the participants, it will be more efficient and less time consuming than gathering the data "by hand". The audio files of the auditive test will be recorded by Arthur and I.
We could however interview the firsts participants by hand to reajust some problems that could arise in the test and form.
