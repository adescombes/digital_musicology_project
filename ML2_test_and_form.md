# ML2

The goal of this Milestone was to build an experimental setup whose aim is to evaluate several characteristic of AP and musical skills for students that are also musicians on the campus.

Several characteristics linked to AP have been tackled by previous studies, and they must be taken into account in this evaluation. The following list contains some of those characteristics that will be linked to questions of the evaluation. In a  first part the questions are more informative on the background of the participants, and in a second part they evaluate their earing capabilities, using audio files attached to the form.



## Participants

The eligibility criteria for the participants is to have followed any musical study and/or to have learned how to play an instrument (by attending classes or in a self-educated way).
The participants will be picked upon musicians of UNIL/EPFL campus. 


## Evaluation interface

The evaluation form will be a Google form that we can send by email to the participants, it will be more efficient and less time consuming than gathering the data "by hand". We could however interview the firsts participants by hand to reajust some problems that could arise in the firsts versions of the form. The results are automatically gathered in a Excel file, and will be analyzed as pursuing of this study. 

However it is to be decided whether the evaluation must be supervised to ensure best reliability of our data, or if the form should be sent to the participants and filled by themselves under our full trust.
  
  
## Procedure and methodology

### Questions

The form will contain several questions that would qualify and evaluate the background of the musician. It will begin by several questions tackling issues that were shown in previous studies :
- AP is known to have strong genetic associations, therefore AP possessors may have siblings who also possess AP (1).
- AP possessors reported beginning their studies at a very young age (at or before 6 years old) : there is a *critical period* in which the subject is more likely to develop AP (from around 4 to 9 y.o.) (1). It can be music lessons as well as more informal or playful forms of increasing tonal awareness.
- Although no studies has been found on this topic, the influence of musical background could also be studied. For instance, a difference may be found in the proportion of AP possessors between musicians more accustomed to improvise and musicians more accustomed to read a score.\

A set of questions will also allow us to categorize the musicians depending on their instrumental practice, age, social environment, appreciation of music and other factors. Categories could be defined a priori, some will probably appear to be relevant after looking at the results from the audio tests.

An other set of questions will consider the subject's own perception of the importance of relative pitch and absolute pitch in their way of playing. These questions could espescially be proposed both in a context of improvisation and playing using either score sheet reading or known tunes. Discrimination will also be put on band or solo performances, for it could be changing (for instance in improvisation) the importance of absolute pitch versus relative pitch.


### Stimuli

This auditive test should evaluate the hearing capacities of the participants. The audio files will consist of recorded samples gathered in a file accessible for all participants by clicking a link available in the form. 

The participants are expected to identify the pitch class. They are not expected to identify the octave, for several reasons : first, there is no difference between AP possessors and nonpossessors in the amount of octave information transmitted, whereas significantly more pitch class information was transmitted to AP possessors than nonpossessors (2); and second the participants may also have difficulty with the terminology for denoting octaves and might therefore be prone to error.

Decisions must be taken according to these following characteristics, that have been shown by previous studies. These characteristics of hearing capacities concern the timbre and register of pitch :
- Among musical instruments, the piano has been acknowledged as possessing the easiest timbre in which to identify pitch (3).
- Familiarity with the timbre of an instrument can be a determinant of the accuracy with which an AP possessor can identify the pitch of tones (4)
- Moreover pitches of pure tones or other electronically produced timbres are more difficult to identify rather than piano timbre (5) 
- AP possessors generally make more accurate pitch identifications in central pitch registers than in very high or low registers (6), and also faster (7), although this observation has got exceptions : a double bass player is often more accurate with low pitches and a violin player is often more accurate in high pitches. In general even if most AP possessors are more accurate in the middle range of the keyboard, they are most accurate in the range of their instrument (6 & 8).
- White-key pitches are identified faster and more accurately than black-key pitches, which correspond to sharp or flat notes (2 & 7).\

Several choices have been taken into account : 
- the timbre of all audio samples will be a sine, so that the timbre will not be a factor of influence in the recognition abilities of the participants;
- the range of the audio samples will span from C3 to B4, as the participants have more chances to be accurate in this range.

Moreover two different tests will be conducted : the samples of the first one will contain individual notes to be identified and its aim will be to evaluate AP possessors. For this first experiment, all notes contained between C3 and B4 will be played once, in a random order. 
The second experiment will serve to evaluate RP possessors, as it could be interesting to find out if some instruments lead to a better relative hearing. However for this task, the format of the audio samples still need to be clarified. For this experiment, either we set a reference note (for example A4) and associate another random note to it, or we play a random interval under two conditions : all intervals between minor second and octave must be equally represented (once each) and the two notes must be comprised in the interval [C3; B4] (this point still needs to be discussed).

# Further steps

For the pursuit of the study, the issue of RP test must be discussed, the audio samples must be constructed, and the form must be set on point.
