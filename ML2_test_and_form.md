# ML2

The goal of this Milestone was to build an experimental setup whose aim is to evaluate several characteristic of AP and musical skills for students that are also musicians on the campus.

Several characteristics linked to AP have been tackled by previous studies, and they must be taken into account in this evaluation. The following list contains some of those characteristics that will be linked to questions of the evaluation. In a  first part the questions are more informative on the background of the participants, and in a second part they evaluate their earing capabilities, using audio files attached to the form. 


### Background

- AP is known to have strong genetic associations, therefore AP possessors may have siblings who also possess AP (1).

- AP possessors reported beginning their studies at a very young age (at or before 6 years old) : there is a *critical period* in which the subject is more likely to develop AP (from around 4 to 9 y.o.) (1). It can be music lessons as well as more informal or playful forms of increasing tonal awareness.

- Although no studies has been found on this topic, the influence of musical background could also be studied. For instance, a difference may be found in the proportion of AP possessors between musicians more accustomed to improvise and musicians more accustomed to read a score.

### Audio test motivation

This auditive test should evaluate the capacities of the participants. The audio files will consist of recorded samples gathered in a file accessible for all participants by clicking a link available in the form. 

The participants are expected to identify the pitch class. They are not expected to identify the octave, for several reasons : first, there is no difference between AP possessors and nonpossessors in the amount of octave information transmitted, whereas significantly more pitch class information was transmitted to AP possessors than nonpossessors (2); and second the participants may also have difficulty with the terminology for denoting octaves and might therefore be prone to error.

- Among musical instruments, the piano has been acknowledged as possessing the easiest timbre in which to identify pitch (3).
- Familiarity with the timbre of an instrument can be a determinant of the accuracy with which an AP possessor can identify the pitch of tones (4)
- Moreover pitches of pure tones or other electronically produced timbres are more difficult to identify rather than piano timbre (5) \

These reasons all concern the pitch timbre. According to them, the samples must consist of pitches played by different timbres among piano, pure tones and various intruments. Among those intruments should be found timbres of violin, cello, guitar and double bass for instance, as chord instruments are the main interest of this study.

- AP possessors generally make more accurate pitch identifications in central pitch registers than in very high or low registers (6), and also faster (7), although this observation has got exceptions : a double bass player is often more accurate with low pitches and a violin player is often more accurate in high pitches. In general even if most AP possessors are more accurate in the middle range of the keyboard, they are most accurate in the range of their instrument (6 & 8).

- White-key pitches are identified faster and more accurately than black-key pitches, which correspond to sharp or flat notes (2 & 7).\

Previous points show the relevancy of identifying the role and relevancy of the change of timbre for absolute pitch evaluation.
The piano has a range going from A0 to C8.

// a compléter pour préciser quelles notes on veut!! //

// samples : //
// 2 x chaque pitch -> 24 notes au total, 1x son de piano, 1x divers sons (guitare, cello, violin, pure sine)//

## Participants

The eligibility criteria for the participants is to have followed any musical study and/or to have learned how to play an instrument (by attending classes or in a self-educated way).
The participants will be picked upon musicians of UNIL/EPFL campus. They can come from any musical background, musical formation, play of any instrument, as long as they correspond to the eligibility criteria.

## Evaluation interface

The evaluation form will be a Google form that we can send by email to the participants, it will be more efficient and less time consuming than gathering the data "by hand".
We could however interview the firsts participants by hand to reajust some problems that could arise in the firsts versions of the form.

The results are automatically gathered in a Excel file, and will be analyzed as pursuing of this study. 
  
## Procedure and methodology

### Questions

The form will contain several questions that would qualify and evaluate the background of the musician.
A set of questions will allow us to categorize the musicians depending on their instrumental practice, age, social environment, appreciation of music and other factors. Categories could to be defined a priori, some will probably appear to be relevant after looking at the results from the audio tests.
An other set of questions will consider the subject's own perception of the importance of relative pitch and absolute pitch in their way of playing. These questions could espescially be proposed both in a context of improvisation and playing using either score sheet reading or known tunes. Discrimination will also be put on band or solo performances, for it could be changing (for instance in improvisation) the importance of absolute pitch versus relative pitch.

The audio files of the auditive test will be recorded by Arthur and I.
